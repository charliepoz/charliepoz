### Hi there 👋

🗣 I'm @charliepoz, a consultant at the World Bank, student at Harvard,and graduate of Oxford.  
🗳 I have an interest in poverty, social protection, GovTech, tools for public policy, and better understanding how groups of people interact.  
🌱 I’m currently learning how to build dashboards, data visualizations, and integrate AI/ML, predominantly in python and R. 
👯️ I would love to collaborate on using tech to better understand elections, poverty, or democracy.  
👾 For fun, I am building a few pet-projects relating to sports, music, or film analyses.
