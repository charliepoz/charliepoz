### Hi there 👋

🗣 I'm @charliepoz, a consultant at the World Bank and an Oxford History graduate. [^1]  
🗳 I have an interest in GovTech, democracy monitoring, tools for public policy, and better understanding sports.  
🌱 I’m currently learning how to build dashboards, data visualizations, and integrate AI/ML, predominantly in python.  
👯️ I would love to collaborate on using tech to better understand elections, policy, or democracy.  
👾 For fun, a pet-project for sports, music, or film analyses.

[^1]: This means I have a craving to throw myself into any and all coding, statistics, and quantitative analysis to combat my humanities-induced inadequacies.
