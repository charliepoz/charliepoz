### Hi there 👋

🗣 I'm @charliepoz, a World Bank consultant, Harvard student, and Oxford graduate.  
🗳 I have an interest in poverty, moonshots, and understanding the workings of systems and networks.  
🌱 I’m currently learning how to integrate AI/ML into my projects, analyses, and data visualizations in Python and R.  
👯️ I would love to collaborate on using tech to better understand elections, poverty, or democracy.  
👾 For fun, I am building a few pet-projects relating to sports, music, and film analyses.
